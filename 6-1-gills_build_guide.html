      <br/><b>(Ignore the potentiometer poking out towards the front. It is an optional headphone volume control, not part of the kit, and you don't have to do anything for Gills to work as intended.)</b>

            <li>
              <p>Now is a good time to solder pin headers to Ksoloti Core if you haven't done so.
              <p>You can insert the headers into the sockets on the Gills PCB to fix them during soldering and get a good fit. No need to aim for a certain distance, the standoffs will take care of that later. Just solder the headers flush to the PCB surface.

              <p class="bomtext">

              <p>If you already soldered any headers other than the ones shown here, no worries - you don't have to remove them to be able to use the Core with Gills.
              <p>That's all you have to do on the Ksoloti Core! Put it aside for now.

            <li>
              Now solder the two 3.5mm expansion jacks on the top side of the PCB.
              <p>Next, solder the two DIN MIDI jacks to the bottom. 
              <p>Then install four each of the 10mm and 20mm standoffs. Installing these standoffs now will make it easy to see if the big capacitor that came with your kit should be installed standing or lying flat. It will also simplify alignment of the remaining parts with the top panel.
              <p>Solder the big capacitor to the bottom now. <b>THIS IS A POLARIZED PART!</b> Make sure to install it the right way. Locate the printed strip on the side of the cap (this marks the "minus" or negative side) and align it so it fits the strip on the silkscreen. If it is less than 20mm tall (in other words, if fits well inside the distance the bottom 20mm standoffs create) you can solder it standing. Otherwise bend its legs and solder it lying flat.

              <p>There are five 10mm standoffs and two 12mm standoffs in your kit! You need 10mm here.
              <p>Note that we only install four of the five 10mm standoffs here. We'll need the fifth one in the next step.

            <li>
              Place some more standoffs as shown in the video. The last remaining 10mm standoff goes near the 3.5mm jacks on the top of the PCB. Screw it together with a 12mm standoff from the bottom.
              <p>Then place one of the three 6mm nylon standoffs on the top (where the silkscreen label for the OLED display is) and screw it together with the other remaining 12mm standoff from the bottom. You guessed it, the nylon standoffs are there to fix the OLED display.
              <p>Next, place the ten single-gang pots, the two dual-gang pots, and the four switches in their corresponding footprints. DO NOT SOLDER THEM YET. The reason we are not soldering the encoder just yet is that its shaft sticks out slightly longer than the pots.

            <li>
              Place the top panel of the enclosure on top of the parts. Make sure the panel is lying flush with the pots and 10mm standoffs and ideally does not bend when you push at its corners.
              <p>Next, check that all 12 pots and 4 switches are aligned well with the panel. If the pots feel too loose to solder reliably, it might be a good idea to temporarily fix them with the included hex nuts. Hand-tight should be fine.
              <p>Now turn around the PCB and solder the 10 single pots, 2 dual pots and 4 switches. On each pot solder one small pin first, then check if alignment is still good. Then solder the remaining pins and the large side legs for stability.

              Attach the remaining two nylon standoffs to the OLED display using two M3 hex screws.
              <p>Remove the top panel.
              <p>Place the OLED display in the PCB footprint, make sure it is aligned flush and reasonably straight (meaning horizontally), then solder the four pins of its header to the PCB. Note that there is no need to fix the two lower nylon standoffs using hex nuts (there are no dedicated hex nuts for this included in the kit).
              <p>If you feel you really want to fix the display and have spare hex nuts at hand (maybe even nylon ones!) you can carefully screw them on. If you use metal hex nuts, make sure they don't touch any parts or component legs which could lead to unexpected behaviour or short circuits!
              <p>Solder the encoder now. It is not as tall as the pots so it does not have a hex nut. The encoder should align itself just fine when you insert it in the PCB footprint.

              <b>If you have the optional CV expander, now is a good time to install it.</b> Otherwise skip this step (duh).
              <p>First, solder the four trimmers then the 2x3-pin header to the bottom of the CV expander PCB. Nothing special here.
              <p>If you want any of the two CV outputs to go from 0V to +10V instead of -5V to +5V, bridge the respective "UNIPOLAR" solder jumper on the top side of the PCB with a dab of solder.
              <p>Make sure the CV expander PCB fits under the top panel and ideally does not touch it. You can compare heights with the nearby 10mm standoff. If the space seems too tight, clip off the 6.35mm audio output jack pins (already soldered to, and protruding from, the Gills PCB) that the CV expander PCB rests on with its trimmers.
              <p>The CV expander is installed into a 2x4-pin header on the Gills PCB, however only 2x3 pins are used by the CV expander. Solder the 2x3 pin header so that on the Gills PCB the two pins closest to the PCB edge stay open, as indicated by the pink arrow in the video clip. 
              <p>Once you've confirmed placement you can remove the bottom 12mm standoff to get a better angle at soldering the header, if necessary.
              <p>That's all, the CV expander is now connected to the respective Core pins and expansion output jacks.
              <p>How to tweak the four trimmers to get a good 1V/oct response is WIPWIPWIP

            <li>
              <p>Place the four LEDs in the respective footprints. DO NOT SOLDER THEM YET. <b>LEDS ARE POLARIZED PARTS!</b> For LED1 and LED2, make sure you place the longer leg (the anode or "plus" side) in the hole marked with "+".
              <p>Now on to the bicolor LEDs. <b>THEY ARE POLARIZED PARTS, TOO!</b> On most bicolor LEDs, the legs have different lengths. The center leg being the longest, pin 1 the second-longest, and pin 3 the shortest. Also there usually is a pattern in the shape of the legs to indicate where pin 1 is. Follow the graphic pattern on the PCB silkscreen print: If you look at the three legs, one of the outer legs will have a square bulge near the LED body (this is pin 1), the other outer leg will have a more triangular bulge (pin 3). If your LEDS do not have this pattern do not worry: insert the longest leg in the center hole and the second-longest in the square hole (where also the square graphic pattern is on the PCB silkscreen).
              <p>Next, we'll do some more top panel action to get the alignment right. Install the top panel and M3 screws back like in the previous step. 
              <p>Wiggle the LEDs and align them as good as possible with the little windows on the panel before soldering them tight.
              <p>This is arguably the trickiest part of the whole build process, but with a little patience and common sense you'll get it right! You can also bend the LEDs after you've soldered them down.
              <p>An optional step in case you encounter too much cross-bleed between LED1 and LED2 (meaning when LED1 lights up, you see a bit of light bleeding into LED2's window, or vice versa); attach dark tape or heat shrink over the side of the LED body to shield off the light.

              <p>Pro tip: attach some rubber feet or furniture "chair leg" pads to the underside. The protruding tabs from the side panels will protect desk surfaces from getting in contact with the bottom hex screws, but even the tabs may still be a bit dangerous to delicate surfaces.

          <p>Congratulations! Unless I forgot something, your Gills is hereby finished! 
          <p>If you installed the CV expander you may want to calibrate it now: Link WIPWIPWIP
          <p><i>Thank you for choosing Ksoloti - A Sound Business for Sound Businesses.</i>
          <p>Now go ahead and patch some objects or whatever. The ksoloti-objects library included in the Ksoloti Patcher has a set of dedicated objects for Gills under "ksoloti/gills". "pot p" for example will read one of the ten pots and provide you with a uni<b><i>p</i></b>olar value between 0 and 64. "pot b" will do the same but will give you a <b><i>b</i></b>ipolar value between -64 and +64. Most inlets expect a certain range and polarity - you can see little + or ± symbols next to some. It is convenient to have dedicated objects for the right polarity as it saves you from having to add a conversion object in the signal chain. Less clutter, more fun.
