            <b>Axoloti</b> is a DIY-friendly digital audio environment for “<i>Sketching digital audio algorithms with the musical playability of standalone hardware.</i>” It is open source and was created by the brilliant Johannes Taelman.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>Axoloti</b> environment essentially consists of two parts:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The <b>software part</b>, called the <b>Patcher</b>, “<i>offers an […] environment similar to Max/MSP, Pure Data or Reaktor</i>” on your Windows, MacOS, or Linux computer. Some it may also remind of the Nord Modular. In the <b>Patcher</b> you have a canvas where you place objects and interconnect them to create or modify sound, just like on a virtual modular synthesizer. See the screenshot below:
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">

            <i>A simple patch in the Axoloti Patcher. Sending a Braids oscillator through a lowpass filter straight to the audio outputs.</i>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Patcher and object libraries are fully open source. Hacking existing objects is comparably easy and encouraged! You can quickly embed most stock objects and, with basic understanding of C/C++, mess with the code to change it to your needs. With some experience, you can also create your own collection of objects from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The <b>hardware</b> part is the board you see in the first image (Axoloti) or below (Ksoloti). The patches you create or edit in the <b>Patcher</b> “<i>run on a standalone powerful microcontroller board : Axoloti Core.</i>” (or Ksoloti Core, respectively) You can preview and play your patch using the “Live” button.
          </p>
          <p>
            When your patch is ready for stanadalone use, you can flash it to the <b>Axoloti Core/Ksoloti Core</b> so you don't need your computer to play it. With a bit more effort you can upload a collection of patches to SD card and set up a controller patch on the <b>Core</b>, allowing you to toggle through your patches at runtime (also without a connection to your computer, of course).
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>Axoloti Core</b> hardware board became unavailable at some point, but because Johannes graciously open-sourced the schematic (and since the global part shortage somewhat improved) it was possible to recreate a board nearly fully compatible to the original: the <b>Ksoloti Core</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In short, the <b>Ksoloti Core</b> aims for maximum compatibility with the original <b>Axoloti Core</b> with some layout changes and added features.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="img/ksoloti_core_top_landscape.jpg" width="800px" height="auto">
            <br/>
            <i>Ksoloti Core v0.5. Size: 59 mm * 90 mm including protruding USB jacks and SD slot.</i>
          </div>

          <p>
            But wait, where are all the jacks? Good thinking! The <b>Ksoloti Core</b> was first designed to be a daughterboard for a Eurorack module. It has been designed to be very thin (overall thickness under 5mm, pin headers aside. The tallest components are the USB Type-C jacks), and to fit parallel behind a 12hp Eurorack panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            However it became clear early on that it is just as fun to run the <b>Ksoloti Core</b> standalone or “headless”. There are several options on how to connect your Core to the outside world, from minimal to full-featured. More on that later!

          </div>
          <p>
            Board dimensions and layout aside, the two main hardware differences to the original <b>Axoloti Core</b> are:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Ksoloti Core</b> does not have any audio and MIDI jacks on-board. (since Core v0.7, MIDI in and out circuitry is on board, so you only need to solder MIDI jacks if you want to use DIN or TRS MIDI.)</li>
              <li><b>Ksoloti Core</b> has more pins and functions broken out to headers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
